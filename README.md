# ComsolOosyte
Phenomenological continuum model to simulate diffusion and osmotic response of oocytes with COMSOL
The specific aim of this work is to model response of oocytes exposed to cryoprotectant solutions taking intracellular complexity into account, i.e., with one or multiple organelles posing barriers to free diffusion in the cell
